    <h2> This is ICF Lake 1</h2>
    <p>The lake had been used as a source of drinking water in the region since the 1930s, when the reservoir was constructed.[2] Till the 1950s, the reservoir was treated through a filtration unit and supplied as drinking water. From the 1950s, the reservoir began to get polluted due to mixing with oil waste and later by linking stormwater drain from the Villivakkam area, and drinking water supply was discontinued.[2] In 2017, the ICF conducted surveys and renovated the lake at a cost of â‚¹ 10 million[3] by removing sludge using dredgers, introducing new fish varieties, and building walking track around the lake.</p>
